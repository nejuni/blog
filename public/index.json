water can be quite shocking, so you’d better learn to prepare your body if you want to try it. But how do you do that? We wear clothes all the time, which de-stimulates our bodies, leaving our vascular systems in poor condition. So what can we do to reduce the impact of the shock and instead allow the ice water to optimize our cardiovascular system? Most of us who live in the West take showers every day, and most of those are warm or hot showers, because we don’t like the cold. But if you end your warm or hot shower with just thirty seconds of cold water—just thirty seconds—you will begin to see results. Anybody is able to endure thirty seconds of cold water, especially after spending several minutes under the warm or hot water, collecting heat. The warm water opens up your veins, aiding your blood flow. So while the cold water might cause you some discomfort at first, thirty seconds is no great hardship.\nWhat happens inside your body when you shift the temperature from warm to cold is that all the little muscles in your vascular system begin to awaken. They close up and then open, close up and open, and this repetitive process establishes the vascular muscle tone that, with repeated exposure, develops into its optimal condition. Start slowly at the beginning, with just fifteen seconds at the end of your shower every day. In a week, you will feel able to endure thirty seconds, or more. This is because the tone of your vascular muscles is improving, developing. Your core body temperature remains just fine. And the result is that you experience better blood flow throughout the day, which gives you a lot more energy. Once you are able to go longer than thirty seconds, you begin to develop an ability to consciously resist the shock of the cold water. You suppress the shiver response, the gasp. Suddenly, the water’s not cold anymore. Instead, it’s a force, and you, standing there, are a counterforce. You’re in control. You’re awakening to the physiological power and the neural activity of your own body. Amazing.\nWEEK 1 Thirty seconds of cold water at the end of a warm shower\nWEEK 2 One minute of cold water at the end of a warm shower\nWEEK 3 A minute and a half of cold water at the end of a warm shower\nWEEK 4 Two minutes of cold water at the end of a warm shower\nDo this gradually and work your way up, at least five days a week. Follow the feeling. Don’t force anything. It’s also fine to start with fifteen seconds and build up more slowly, as we do in our 20-Day Cold Shower Challenge.\nSome benefits of cold exposure begin at 60° Fahrenheit, so most tap water is cold enough to make a difference. As your vascular muscle tone develops, it will absorb more and more of the shock until it’s hardly a shock at all. Your vascular system constricts on demand to protect your vital parts. And what you will see is that your heart rate goes down during the day, reducing your stress level. You feel more energized. The improved blood flow delivers better nutrition to your cells. You find that you don’t get sick anymore because your body is no longer vulnerable. Instead, you feel strong.\nBy the end of the fourth week, your vascular tone will be optimized to the point that it will be mind over matter. You turn the knob to cold and will your body not to react in shock. This is only the beginning of the power of the mind opening up to you. If you are able to command the vascular system, which is everywhere within your body, you are able to go, at will, to any part and control it consciously. You’re the boss. And it all starts with thirty seconds of cold water.\nTHE WIM HOF WAY TO GET WARM Are you one of those people who feels cold all the time? Would you like to be able to warm your body even when you don’t have access to an external heat source? If so, the following exercise can be done to activate brown fat tissue (or brown adipose tissue — BAT), which is capable of energy combustion, and your intercostal muscles. The intercostal muscles are several groups of muscles that run between the ribs and help move the chest wall during respiration. Activating them also generates heat.\nDo as follows:\n1. Sit down. 2. Inhale slowly and deeply five or six times, letting your breath go naturally each time. 3. Inhale fully. 4. Relax to exhale. 5. Inhale fully. 6. Hold your breath, for no more than five seconds. 7. Tense your upper-back muscles and chest while you hold your breath — but don’t tense the head. Keep your jaw relaxed. 8. Let go. With practice, you will feel the heat flowing down from your neck to your whole body. Everybody is different, but with practice, you will feel the heat coming from inside your body. This is what I did to maintain my core body temperature during the experiments at Wayne State — but please do not try such experiments at home!\nICE-WATER BATH FOR WARMER HANDS AND FEET Are you someone who suffers from cold hands or feet? If so, try this exercise.7\n- STEP 1 Fill a bucket with one-third ice and two-thirds water. - STEP 2 Redirect your mental focus to your hands (or feet). - STEP 3 Place your hands or feet into the ice bucket. - STEP 4 Hold your hands or feet in the bucket for two minutes. At some point, they should start to feel warm instead of cold. - STEP 5 Remove your hands or feet from the ice bucket, but keep your mental focus on them. - STEP 6 Shake them out several times to encourage the blood flow into your newly awakened extremities. Your blood vessels constrict in the ice bucket at first. This is a natural protective mechanism. But then they open when your blood reaches 50 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing warm blood to flood into them. You are resetting the physiology in your extremities. People who often complain of cold hands or feet suffer from poor vasoconstriction and dilation. The muscles around the veins in their hands and feet do not function well and need to be retrained. This ice-bucket exercise helps. If you typically have cold hands or feet, try doing this exercise daily. Adaptation occurs rather quickly. After a couple of days of this exercise, you will find that your extremities aren’t so cold anymore.\nWHM PROTOCOL: BASIC BREATHING EXERCISE Before engaging with this breathing technique, remember to be mindful. Listen to your body and learn from the signals your body and mind send you while you are doing the exercises. Use those signals as personal feedback about the effect of the exercises on your body and mind, and adjust them as needed to find what works best for you.3\nSTEP 1 Sit in a meditation posture, lying down, or whichever way is most comfortable for you, in a quiet and safe environment. Make sure you can expand your lungs freely without feeling any constriction.\nSTEP 2 Close your eyes and try to clear your mind. Be conscious about your breath and try to fully connect with it. Take thirty to forty deep breaths in through the nose or mouth. Fill up your belly, your chest, all the way up to your head. Don’t force the exhale. Just relax and let the air out. Fully in, letting go.\nSTEP 3 At the end of the last breath, draw the breath in once more and fill the lungs to maximum capacity without using any force. Then relax to let the air out. Hold the breath until you feel the urge to breathe again. This is called the retention phase.\nSTEP 4 When you feel the urge to breathe, take one deep breath in and hold it for ten to fifteen seconds. This is called the recovery breath.\nSTEP 5 Let your breath go and start with a new round. Fully in, letting go. Repeat the full cycle three to four times.\nAfter having completed this breathing exercise, take your time to enjoy the feeling. With repeated practice, this protocol becomes more and more like a meditation.\nOnce you have a little experience with the basic breathing exercise, try this additional technique: In round 2, step 4, try “squeezing” the breath to your head when you take your recovery breath. You do this by tensing your pelvic floor and directing that sense of tension to the core of your body and up to your head, while keeping the rest of your body relaxed. You should feel a sense of pressure in your head. Then relax everything when you exhale.\nAltitude IN CASE OF ALTITUDE HEADACHES Headaches are the first sign of altitude sickness; a headache indicates that the brain is being deprived of oxygen. This exercise fuels your brain with oxygen again and should bring instant relief.\n1. Slow down your pace. 2. Breathe in fully and relax to exhale ten times. 3. Stand still or sit. Make sure you are in a secure position. 4. Breathe in fully, hold your breath for five seconds, and try squeezing or redirecting the breath to your head. 5. Let go. 6. Repeat these steps until you sense that the headache has disappeared. BREATHING EXERCISE WHILE WALKING AT HIGH ALTITUDE Consciously breathe more than you feel you need to.\nFocus on your breath. Feel yourself breathing as you move.\nSynchronize your breath and your pace so you can get into a cadence. Find your own rhythm without forcing it.\nRESTING BREATHING EXERCISE TO ADJUST TO AN ALTITUDE GREATER THAN THIRTEEN THOUSAND FEET This exercise can help you to forestall the potentially dangerous symptoms caused by a low oxygen level in your body that you may encounter if climbing or visiting somewhere where the altitude exceeds thirteen thousand feet. Please do not rely on this exercise to prevent altitude sickness symptoms without the proper supervision or experience. The best way to safely learn it is to participate in one of our expeditions. See “Further Reading” for more information. It is helpful to use a saturation meter to measure your blood oxygen level when doing this.\nWake up four to four-and-a-half hours after you went to sleep.\nDo the Basic Breathing Exercise until your saturation meter reads a minimum of 95 to 100 percent saturation.\nPractice the breathing exercises for at least a half hour.\nGo back to sleep\nEXTENDING YOUR RETENTION TIME You can control your biochemistry with your breath. Don’t believe me? Well try this:\nSTEP 1 Breathe normally, then exhale fully, hold your breath out, and time how long you can hold it for.\nSTEP 2 Do the same thing after taking thirty deep breaths, relaxing the air out on the exhale.\nBig difference, huh? The reason why you can hold your breath for so much longer after taking thirty deep breaths is because the deep breathing temporarily changes the ratio between carbon dioxide and oxygen in your blood. Because your breathing reflex is correlated to the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood and you just exhaled a lot of carbon dioxide, you can hold your breath for longer. Carbon dioxide is an acid, and the breathing causes your pH level to increase, bringing your body into a temporarily alkaline state\nWHM PROTOCOL: BASIC MINDSET EXERCISE The greatest accomplishment you can achieve is stillness of the mind. It is only when your mind is still that you can go from external to internal programming. In the absence of thoughts, this stillness brings your feelings into alignment with your innermost being, reflecting the true self in a direct mirror. This is how I was able to set all of my records, and you can do it too.\nFirst, take a step away and find a comfortable place to sit down. Then begin to follow the breath.\nDeeply in, letting go.\nDeeply in, letting go.\nPeacefully following the breath.\nDeeply in, letting go.\nDeeply in, letting go.\nA sense of calm will begin to settle over you, and it is in this moment that you can set your mind. Begin to scan your body while visualizing what it is you are going to do. Perhaps you want to stay longer in the cold shower or achieve a new personal record for push-ups. Maybe you want to hold a particularly challenging yoga pose or take a longer bike ride than you ever have before. Now is the time to scan your body and set your intention. Take your time with it. Tell your body what you expect it to do. Scan yourself for how you feel. You will be able to detect any misalignment of your intention and your body’s feeling. Just remain calm, keep breathing, and wait for the moment in which there is a sense of trust, of centered energy, of alignment.\nGive power to that feeling with your breath and then go and do what you intend to do. Success.\nWHM MEDITATION The origins of meditation date back to 5000–3500 BCE, yet it’s constantly evolving. When you do the conscious breathing protocol, you are already doing a form of meditation, training your mind and connecting with your innermost depths. The principle of meditation is to follow something that does not excite the thinking brain. We take something very simple and follow it until deep peace comes over us. Here is one way to get acquainted with this peace.\nSit down in a safe, comfortable place and clear your mind.\nStart connecting to your breath. Let yourself breathe naturally.\nStart counting your breaths. Each inhale and exhale is one count. Count your breaths up to seven, and then from seven back to one. If you find yourself suddenly thinking about your daily life and your to-do list, return to counting the breaths. You will eventually find yourself able to just count the breaths, up to seven and back down again. The blood flow will go into the deeper areas of your brain, awakening feeling, not thoughts. Let the feeling become stronger. Follow the feeling and go as deep as you want. As you go along, the counting will fade away, like a song fading out. Follow the feeling and go deep into yourself, deep into peace.\nBreath While seated or lying down, take 30 to 40 full conscious breaths: Breathe fully in to the belly and the chest, then letting go, without force.\nOn your final exhale, let the air out and hold it out for as long as you can without discomfort. Listen to your body and don’t force it!\nWhen you feel the urge to breathe again, take a deep breath in, hold for 10 to 15 seconds. Then release and relax.\nRepeat the steps above two or three more times, paying attention to how you feel and adjusting your breath as needed.\nRest in this elevated state until you are ready to move on with your day. Alternatively, use the energy you just generated for your morning workout or yoga practice. Experiment with what feels right for you.\nCongratulations! You just influenced key drivers of your health, increased your vitality and focus, busted your stress, reduced inflammation factors, and optimized your immune system.\nMind Your post-breathing practice state is the perfect time to program your mindset. Try this:\nBefore you get up from your breathing practice, bring up a thought in your mind like “Today I’m going to stay in the cold shower for 15 more seconds than yesterday,” or “I feel happy, healthy, and strong.”\nReflect on this thought and notice how your body feels.\nIf you identify any inner resistance to your intention, just keep breathing steadily until you feel an alignment between your body and mind.\nWith practice, your sense of your inner experience, or interoception, will sharpen, allowing you to more consciously observe and control your body and mind.\nCold At the end of your warm shower, turn the water to cold.\nIf you like you can start by first putting your feet and legs, than your arms, then your full torso under the water.\nDo NOT do the WHM Basic Breathing Exercise while standing in the shower.\nGradually extend your exposure every day until you can handle two minutes in the cold.\nIf you are shivering when you get out, try the horse stance exercise. (See “How Long Can You Hold a Horse Stance?” for details.)\nSuccess! You just improved your metabolic efficiency, regulated your hormones, further reduced inflammation, and are enjoying the endorphins and endocannabinoids released in response to the cold.\nWHM PROTOCOL: POWER BREATHING FOR ENDURANCE This exercise is an adaptation of the Basic Breathing Exercise to enhance athletic performance. You can delay the deprivation of oxygen in the muscle tissue, thereby postponing the point of lactic acidification, which leads to fatigue and failure. The breathing exercise causes a release of adrenaline and glucose that your body can absorb immediately and achieve better performance.\nBefore you begin an endurance exercise, such as long distance running or cycling, do three to four rounds of power breathing:\nBreathe in deeply and relax to let your breath go sixty times.\nOn the last breath, inhale fully and then hold the breath for at least fifteen seconds (or as long as feels comfortable), squeeze your entire body toward the head by tensing your pelvic floor and allowing that pressurized feeling to move up your spine to the top of your head.\nRelax to let your breath go and start a new round.\nStart each new round with your regular WHM breathing rhythm, and then increase the speed and intensity of your breathing as the round proceeds. This increase is what makes this power breathing.\nWait a couple of minutes to ground yourself again and then begin your endurance exercise.\nBreathe more than you feel is necessary and stay aware of your breath during the endurance exercise.\nBREATHING FOR PAIN REGULATION When practicing the WHM for pain regulation, you’re consciously manipulating your body and the pain you feel through the use of the breathing techniques.\nBegin by sitting or lying down in a comfortable position. Once you are relaxed, direct your attention to the spot where you feel the pain. Then take five calm, deep breaths.\nNow take twenty more deep breaths. Fully in, and letting go. Do not force your breath.\nExhale the last breath fully out, then inhale fully in once more, and hold it for ten seconds.\nWhile holding the breath, focus your attention on the point of pain, and press your held breath toward it. Tense the muscles around the pain area as well.\nRelease your breath and all tension.\nThink of the painful sensation as a signal. Motivate yourself to listen to this signal and become attuned to it. This signal tells you that the chemistry in this area needs to change, or is changing. A positive train of thought or mindset influences the perception of pain. The purpose is not to suppress the pain signal, but to change the internal chemistry that causes the pain in the first place.\nWHM PROTOCOL: ICE BATHS AND COLD PLUNGES Getting into the cold in nature—there is nothing like it. And taking an ice bath is an amazing way to show yourself what you are capable of. To befriend the cold at home or in the wild, follow these steps:\nFirst, find someone to share this experience with you. Ice baths and cold plunges are safer and more fun with friends.\nPrepare yourself by doing one or two rounds of the basic breathing exercise as you visualize the cold water. How will it make you feel? Imagine how you will enter the water, be it a bathtub or a lake, and how you will feel when you do it. Assume a can-do mindset.\nConfidently enter the water while taking deep, calm breaths. Focus on your breath. Embrace the cold; let it take you to the depths of yourself. Do NOT perform the WHM basic breathing technique. Instead, do long, conscious, exhalations to bring your breath into a controlled, steady rhythm. Take deep breaths through the nose and try to relax. Try letting out a long “Hummmmm” on the exhale.\nKeep your focus on your breath and your being as you exit the water. Warm up by doing the horse stance exercise while maintaining your inner attention. (See “How Long Can You Hold a Horse Stance?”)\nThe cold is our warm friend, our mirror, and our teacher. It can also be dangerous. When you extend exposure to the cold by going into an ice bath or open body of water, it is an intense experience. If you want to try an ice bath or a cold plunge, make sure you are being safe and smart about it. For a thorough training in safe cold exposure, please visit wimhofmethod.com to sign up for one of our courses or workshops.\nBREATHING FOR MOOD REGULATION This exercise uses and trains neurostimulative brain control to help alleviate moodiness or depression. Supplying oxygen to the brain improves a person’s well-being. We have seen in fMRIs that the whole brain dances when subjects do the breathing exercises. You can do this exercise whenever you feel like it, but it can be an especially powerful exercise to try if you are feeling melancholy, moody, or depressed. Do not force it — feel it!\nSit or lie down in a safe, comfortable place.\nFeel and try to relax every part of your body. Observe and be aware of what you are feeling, seeing, and hearing, without judgment. Just be present.\nTake twenty deep breaths. Fully in and letting go.\nOn the last breath, breathe in deeply, hold it, press your chin toward your chest, tense your pelvic floor, and direct that tension up your core toward your head.\nIf you are experiencing any physical discomfort, focus your attention there and observe. Tense the muscles in that area. Hold the breath for a maximum of ten seconds.\nRelease the breath and all tension.\nRepeat two or three times or until you feel better.\nINTEROCEPTION WITH THE BREATH How would you like to train your sense of interoception and sharpen your interoceptive focus? If you are already practicing the Basic Breathing Exercise, you are on your way. This visualization practice will take you to the next level.\nSit or lie down in a safe, comfortable space and close your eyes.\nBreathe normally, but focus on your breathing. Fully in and letting go.\nNow consciously take a deep breath in through the nose, and exhale through the mouth. Do not force it.\nVisualize your lungs, and consciously feel the oxygen entering your lungs. Interoception is now beginning.\nTake some more deep breaths. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Nice and easy.\nAfter a few more breaths, visualize the exchange of gases in your body. Visualize the oxygen going from the lungs, through the capillaries and into the blood, and visualize the excretion of carbon dioxide upon exhalation.\nIf you notice that your mind has started to wander, simply reset your focus to your breath. Over time, you will learn to become more mindful and gain more control over your mind and be less consumed by your thoughts.\nPractice this exercise for several minutes.\nINTEROCEPTION OF THE HEARTBEAT In this exercise we are going to forge a conscious connection with the heart and circulatory system. Because the heartbeat is involuntary, few of us pay much attention to it or to the circulatory system it serves. But if we channel our interoceptive focus to it, we can decrease our heart rate during times of stress, which not only serves to relieve that stress but also to improve the absorption of oxygen and nutrients within our cells. Here’s how:\nSit or lie down in a safe, comfortable space.\nRelax.\nFeel and visualize your heartbeat.\nConnect with your heartbeat and try to synchronize your breath with it so that you can feel it everywhere.\nNow visualize your circulatory system. Visualize that with every inhalation, oxygen-rich blood is flowing from your lungs to your heart, to every part in your body, through a network of blood vessels that could wrap around the earth two and a half times. Imagine how your blood provides oxygen and nutrients to organs and muscles, and transports waste products (like carbon dioxide) to your liver, kidneys, and lungs.\nReconnect with your heartbeat and try to synchronize your breath with it again.\nMake a journey through your body and try to feel the heartbeat in different parts of it. If you focus on your hand, feel the heartbeat there, and if you focus on your feet, feel the blood flow from your ankles to your toes.\nThis is connecting your mind and your body. This is interoceptive focus. A couple of minutes per day is enough to help you deepen this connection and reap the benefits of it.\nBREATHING FOR STRESS CONTROL Stress is the killer in our Western society — all that thinking, going into overdrive, making deadlines. They really are dead lines! Stress deregulates our system. You can tell if you are stressed by counting how many times you breathe in a minute. Try it now with a timer. If you’re breathing between fifteen to twenty times a minute, you are stressed.\nWhat I do for stress is one minute of humming and breathing. This always works for me. It taps into your parasympathetic nervous system — where the peace is inside — and calms down your hectic sympathetic nervous system. And it’s like a massage for your spine from within — all the way up to your brain stem and to the center of your head. It brings you directly inside your body.\nSet a timer for one minute.\nSettle yourself somewhere comfortable.\nBreathe in deeply.\nBreathe out with a sound like “Hum,” “Ah,” or “Om.” Make whatever sounds make you happy.\nWhen you run out of air, breathe in deeply and let it out with another “Hum.”\nContinue until the timer stops.\nHow many times did you breathe in a minute of humming? Maybe four, five, six times? Nice.\nUNITE WITH THE LIGHT: THE “STROBOSCOPE” EXERCISE Beautiful being, beautiful soul, would you like to illuminate your consciousness? Come, just lie here on the sofa. Are you comfortable? Do you feel good? Hey, what did you do this morning? You say you woke up? I did the same thing! Wow, parallel universe. You say you have stress, tension, all that mental shit? Whatever you are thinking, I don’t care. Let it go. Let it go. Now all there is for you to do is relax and breathe. Just drop everything and get into this breathing. We are all lightworkers. Work with the light and get free.\nSit in a relaxed, comfortable position.\nClose your eyes, follow your breath, witness yourself calming down.\nJust look at what you see with your eyes closed. Don’t try to see anything in particular. Be patient. In this way, your energy is able to disconnect from the external perception of the visual cortex and go into the deeper realms of the brain.\nKeep following your breath, and turn your inner focus to the center of your forehead, the “third eye.” You may see a luminous halo that pulses with your breath — in, out, in, out, like the flashing light from a stroboscope. You might feel you want to look more directly at it, but then you will take away the intensity. Learn to let it be. This is a phenomenal way to subtly observe the neural activity of your brain.\nOnce you have some experience with this meditation, try adding the focus on the center of your forehead to the Basic Breathing Exercise. You may start to have spontaneous experiences of your inner light.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:8080/docs/cold/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"whm-protocol-cold-exposure-for-beginners\"\u003eWHM PROTOCOL: COLD EXPOSURE FOR BEGINNERS\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing into the ice water can be quite shocking, so you’d better learn to prepare your body if you want to try it. But how do you do that? We wear clothes all the time, which de-stimulates our bodies, leaving our vascular systems in poor condition. So what can we do to reduce the impact of the shock and instead allow the ice water to optimize our cardiovascular system? Most of us who live in the West take showers every day, and most of those are warm or hot showers, because we don’t like the cold. But if you end your warm or hot shower with just thirty seconds of cold water—just thirty seconds—you will begin to see results.\nAnybody is able to endure thirty seconds of cold water, especially after spending several minutes under the warm or hot water, collecting heat. The warm water opens up your veins, aiding your blood flow. So while the cold water might cause you some discomfort at first, thirty seconds is no great hardship.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"cold"},{"content":"Age CLI Tool - Complete Guide (2025) A modern encryption tool for Unix \u0026amp; Linux. age is a simple, modern and secure file encryption tool, format, and Go library.\nProject: FiloSottile/age\nTable of Contents Installation Quick Start Basic Concepts Daily Commands Examples Advanced Usage Best Practices Installation In Termux pkg update pkg install age Verify Installation age --version Quick Start Generate a Key Pair age-keygen -o -f ~/.ssh/age_key.txt Encrypt a File age -r \u0026lt;PUBLIC_KEY\u0026gt; -o encrypted.txt.age plaintext.txt Decrypt a File age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt encrypted.txt.age Basic Concepts Key Components Component Description Public Key Recipient key (x25519 format) - used to encrypt Private Key Sender key - kept secret, used to decrypt age file Encrypted file with .age extension (convention) Passphrase Alternative to key-based encryption Key Formats Public Keys: Start with age1 (example: age1aaa2xmjspxn73gv4py3n...)

Public Key vs Private Key** - **Public Key** (starts with `age1`): Share freely, anyone can encrypt for you - **Private Key** (starts with `AGE-SECRET-KEY-1`): Keep secret, only you decrypt **2. Two Encryption Methods:** - **Key-based:** Fast, secure, for files you want to share - **Passphrase-based:** When you don\u0026#39;t want to manage keys --- ### **Step-by-Step Daily Usage:** #### **Day 1: Initial Setup** ```bash # Generate your personal key age-keygen -o -f ~/.ssh/age_key.txt # View output - you\u0026#39;ll see your public key # Example: age1aaa2xmjspxn73gv4py3n... # Extract just the public key age-keygen -y ~/.ssh/age_key.txt # Output: age1aaa2xmjspxn73gv4py3n... Day 2: Encrypt Your First File # Create a test file echo \u0026#34;This is secret data\u0026#34; \u0026gt; secret.txt # Encrypt it with your public key age -r age1aaa2xmjspxn73gv4py3n... -o secret.txt.age secret.txt # You now have: # secret.txt.age (encrypted - safe to share/store) # secret.txt (original - delete this!) # Delete the original rm secret.txt Day 3: Decrypt When Needed # Decrypt and view content age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt secret.txt.age # Decrypt and save to file age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt secret.txt.age \u0026gt; secret.txt # Decrypt and pipe to other command age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt secret.txt.age | cat Practical Real-World Examples: Example 1: Backup Your Phone\u0026rsquo;s Photos # Connect phone, mount photos folder, then: # Compress all photos tar czf photos_backup.tar.gz ~/photos/ # Encrypt backup age -r $(age-keygen -y ~/.ssh/age_key.txt) \\ -o photos_backup.tar.gz.age \\ photos_backup.tar.gz # Upload to cloud (safe now!) # Cloud services can\u0026#39;t read it # Delete originals rm -rf photos_backup.tar.gz Example 2: Share Password with Friend # Friend generates their key and gives you their public key # They tell you: age1friend... # You have a WiFi password you want to share echo \u0026#34;WiFi_Pass123!\u0026#34; | age -r age1friend... \u0026gt; wifi.age # Send them wifi.age # They decrypt: age -d -i ~/their_key.txt wifi.age Example 3: Encrypt Database Credentials # Create credentials file cat \u0026gt; db_creds.json \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF { \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;db.example.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;super_secret_password\u0026#34; } EOF # Encrypt it age -p -o db_creds.json.age db_creds.json # Prompted: Enter passphrase: # Delete original rm db_creds.json # In your application, before startup: mv \u0026lt;(age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt db_creds.json.age) db_creds.json # App reads db_creds.json, then system deletes it after startup Example 4: Secure System Backup # Backup /etc directory (contains system config) sudo tar czf etc_backup.tar.gz /etc/ # Encrypt it age -r $(age-keygen -y ~/.ssh/age_key.txt) \\ -o etc_backup.tar.gz.age \\ etc_backup.tar.gz # Store on external USB or cloud # If system fails, you can restore # Decrypt: age -d -i age_key.txt etc_backup.tar.gz.age | tar xzf - Example 5: Create a Personal Vault Script #!/bin/bash # Save as: ~/bin/my_vault.sh # chmod +x ~/bin/my_vault.sh # Personal vault manager MY_KEY=\u0026#34;$HOME/.ssh/age_key.txt\u0026#34; VAULT_DIR=\u0026#34;$HOME/.vault_encrypted\u0026#34; mkdir -p \u0026#34;$VAULT_DIR\u0026#34; case \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; in save) # Save and encrypt a file if [ -z \u0026#34;$2\u0026#34; ]; then echo \u0026#34;Usage: my_vault.sh save \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;\u0026#34; exit 1 fi PUBLIC=$(age-keygen -y \u0026#34;$MY_KEY\u0026#34;) age -r \u0026#34;$PUBLIC\u0026#34; -o \u0026#34;$VAULT_DIR/$(basename $2).age\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$2\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;✓ Encrypted: $2\u0026#34; ;; open) # Decrypt and open if [ -z \u0026#34;$2\u0026#34; ]; then echo \u0026#34;Usage: my_vault.sh open \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt;\u0026#34; exit 1 fi age -d -i \u0026#34;$MY_KEY\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$VAULT_DIR/$2.age\u0026#34; ;; list) # List encrypted files ls -lh \u0026#34;$VAULT_DIR\u0026#34; ;; esac # Usage examples: # my_vault.sh save mypasswords.txt # my_vault.sh list # my_vault.sh open mypasswords.txt Security Tips for Termux: # 1.

It uses a delta-transfer algorithm that only sends differences between files, making it extremely efficient for:\nBacking up files locally or remotely Mirroring directories Incremental backups Synchronizing files between devices Key Features (as of 2025) Delta-transfer algorithm - only transfers changed portions Compression - reduces network bandwidth usage Preservation - maintains permissions, timestamps, ownership Partial transfers - resume interrupted transfers SSH integration - secure remote transfers Exclude patterns - flexible file filtering Installation in Termux # Update package list pkg update # Install rsync pkg install rsync # Verify installation rsync --version Expected output:\nrsync version 3.3.0 protocol version 31 Basic Syntax rsync [OPTIONS] SOURCE DESTINATION Important Notes: Trailing slash matters! rsync -av /source/ /dest/ - copies contents of source rsync -av /source /dest/ - copies source directory itself Most Useful Daily Commands 1. Basic Local Copy rsync -av /source/ /destination/ -a = archive mode (preserves permissions, timestamps, etc.) -v = verbose (shows files being transferred) 2. Copy with Progress Bar rsync -av --progress /source/ /destination/ Shows real-time transfer progress.\n3. Dry Run (Test Before Executing) rsync -av --dry-run /source/ /destination/ Shows what would be transferred without actually doing it.\n4. Delete Files in Destination Not in Source rsync -av --delete /source/ /destination/ Makes destination an exact mirror of source.\n5. Copy Over SSH (Remote Sync) rsync -avz -e ssh user@remote:/path/to/source/ /local/destination/ -z = compress during transfer -e ssh = use SSH protocol 6.

Testing Commands Safely Always use --dry-run first:\nrsync -av --dry-run /source/ /destination/ 4. Monitoring Progress For large transfers, use:\nrsync -avh --progress --stats /source/ /destination/ 5. Dealing with Special Characters Use quotes around paths with spaces:\nrsync -av \u0026#34;/path/with spaces/\u0026#34; \u0026#34;/another path/\u0026#34; 6. Network Transfers For WiFi transfers between devices, ensure both are on the same network and SSH server is running on the destination.\nTroubleshooting Issue: \u0026ldquo;Permission denied\u0026rdquo; Solution:\n# Check permissions ls -la /path/to/directory # Grant storage access in Termux termux-setup-storage # Use appropriate user permissions rsync -av --chmod=ugo=rwX /source/ /destination/ Issue: \u0026ldquo;Connection refused\u0026rdquo; (remote sync) Solution:\n# Ensure SSH is running on remote device # In Termux, install and start SSH: pkg install openssh sshd # Check SSH port (default 8022 in Termux) rsync -av -e \u0026#34;ssh -p 8022\u0026#34; /source/ user@remote:/dest/ Issue: Transfer is too slow Solution:\n# Use compression for network transfers rsync -avz /source/ /destination/ # Or disable compression for local transfers rsync -av --no-compress /source/ /destination/ Issue: \u0026ldquo;rsync: command not found\u0026rdquo; Solution:\npkg update pkg install rsync Issue: Files not being deleted with \u0026ndash;delete Solution:\n# Ensure correct syntax (source has trailing slash) rsync -av --delete /source/ /destination/ # Check dry-run first rsync -av --delete --dry-run /source/ /destination/ Quick Reference Card Essential Command Template rsync -avh --progress [--delete] [--exclude=\u0026#39;pattern\u0026#39;] /source/ /destination/ Most Used Options Combination # Local backup with progress rsync -avhP /source/ /backup/ # Remote sync compressed rsync -avzP -e ssh /local/ user@remote:/path/ # Exact mirror (delete extra files) rsync -avh --delete /source/ /mirror/ # Safe test run rsync -avn /source/ /destination/ Additional Resources Official Documentation: https://rsync.samba.org/documentation.html Man Page: man rsync (in Termux: rsync --help) GitHub Repository: https://github.com/WayneD/rsync Rsync Examples: https://rsync.samba.org/examples.html Version History Notes rsync 3.3.0 (April 2024) - Latest Improved performance for large file transfers Enhanced support for extended attributes Better error reporting and handling Security improvements Key Changes from 3.2.x to 3.3.0: New --copy-as option for permission handling Improved --mkpath functionality Enhanced checksum algorithms Better handling of symbolic links Created for Termux users | Updated October 2025\n--- ## How to Use This Guide ### Step 1: Save the Markdown File ```bash # In Termux, create the file nano rsync-guide.md # Paste the content above, then save with Ctrl+X, Y, Enter Step 2: View the Guide Anytime # Install a markdown viewer (optional) pkg install mdcat # View with formatting mdcat rsync-guide.md # Or use basic cat/less less rsync-guide.md Step 3: Start with Basic Examples Example 1: Backup Your Documents\n# First, check what will be copied (dry run) rsync -avn ~/Documents/ ~/storage/shared/Backups/Documents/ # If looks good, do the actual sync rsync -avh --progress ~/Documents/ ~/storage/shared/Backups/Documents/ Example 2: Sync Photos to SD Card\n# Backup camera photos rsync -avh --progress ~/storage/dcim/Camera/ /sdcard/PhotoBackup/ Example 3: Mirror a Directory\n# Make an exact copy (including deletions) rsync -avh --delete --progress ~/Important/ ~/Important_Backup/ Step 4: Practice with Dry Runs Before any major operation, always test first:\nrsync -avn [your-options] /source/ /destination/ The -n flag shows what would happen without actually doing it.\nStep 5: Create Your Own Backup Script # Create a simple backup script nano my-backup.sh Add this content:\n#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash # Simple backup script echo \u0026#34;Starting backup...\u0026#34; rsync -avh --progress \\ --exclude=\u0026#39;*.tmp\u0026#39; \\ ~/storage/shared/Important/ \\ ~/storage/shared/Backups/Important-$(date +%Y%m%d)/ echo \u0026#34;Backup completed!\u0026#34; Make it executable:\nchmod +x my-backup.sh ./my-backup.sh Key Concepts Explained 1. Archive Mode (-a) This is equivalent to: -rlptgoD\nr = recursive (include subdirectories) l = copy symlinks as symlinks p = preserve permissions t = preserve modification times g = preserve group o = preserve owner D = preserve device files and special files 2. Trailing Slash Difference # WITH trailing slash - copies CONTENTS rsync -av /source/ /dest/ # Result: /dest/file1, /dest/file2 # WITHOUT trailing slash - copies DIRECTORY rsync -av /source /dest/ # Result: /dest/source/file1, /dest/source/file2 3. Delete Option Behavior rsync -av --delete /source/ /destination/ Deletes files in destination that don\u0026rsquo;t exist in source Makes destination an exact mirror Use with caution! Test with --dry-run first 4. Exclude vs Include # Exclude specific patterns rsync -av --exclude=\u0026#39;*.tmp\u0026#39; /source/ /dest/ # Include only specific files (exclude everything else) rsync -av --include=\u0026#39;*.pdf\u0026#39; --exclude=\u0026#39;*\u0026#39; /source/ /dest/ # Complex filtering rsync -av \\ --include=\u0026#39;*/\u0026#39; \\ --include=\u0026#39;*.jpg\u0026#39; \\ --include=\u0026#39;*.png\u0026#39; \\ --exclude=\u0026#39;*\u0026#39; \\ /source/ /dest/ Safety Checklist Before running any rsync command:\n✅ Always use --dry-run first with new commands ✅ Double-check source and destination paths ✅ Be careful with --delete flag - it permanently removes files ✅ Check trailing slashes - they change behavior ✅ Test with small directory first before large operations ✅ Have backups of important data before major syncs ✅ Verify permissions on destination directory This guide covers everything you need for daily rsync usage in Termux as of 2025.

Understanding Git Basics Git is a distributed version control system. Think of it as a time machine for your code that lets you:\nTrack changes over time Collaborate with others Experiment safely with branches Recover from mistakes The Three States Git has three main states for your files:\nWorking Directory: Your actual files you\u0026rsquo;re editing Staging Area (Index): Files prepared for commit Repository (.git directory): Committed snapshots of your project Visual Flow:\nWorking Directory → (git add) → Staging Area → (git commit) → Repository 2. Starting a New Project Scenario: You want to create a new Android app project and track it with Git.\n# Navigate to your projects folder cd ~/storage/shared/Projects # Create new directory mkdir MyApp cd MyApp # Initialize Git repository git init # Output: Initialized empty Git repository in /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/shared/Projects/MyApp/.git/ # Configure for this project git config user.name \u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34; git config user.email \u0026#34;john@example.com\u0026#34; # Create initial files echo \u0026#34;# MyApp\u0026#34; \u0026gt; README.md echo \u0026#34;node_modules/\u0026#34; \u0026gt; .gitignore echo \u0026#34;*.log\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; .gitignore # Stage all files git add . # Check what\u0026#39;s staged git status # Output: # On branch main # Changes to be committed: # new file: .gitignore # new file: README.md # Make first commit git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit with README and gitignore\u0026#34; # Output: # [main (root-commit) a1b2c3d] Initial commit with README and gitignore # 2 files changed, 3 insertions(+) 3. Daily Development Workflow Scenario: You\u0026rsquo;re working on adding a login feature.\n# Check current status git status # Create feature branch git checkout -b feature/login # Output: Switched to a new branch \u0026#39;feature/login\u0026#39; # Create login file nano login.js # (write your code) # Check what changed git status # Output: # On branch feature/login # Untracked files: # login.js # Stage the new file git add login.js # Commit with descriptive message git commit -m \u0026#34;Add login form with email validation\u0026#34; # Continue working... nano login.js # (make more changes) # See what changed since last commit git diff login.js # Stage and commit git add login.js git commit -m \u0026#34;Add password strength indicator\u0026#34; # View your commits git log --oneline # Output: # b2c3d4e Add password strength indicator # a1b2c3d Add login form with email validation 4. Working with GitHub Scenario: You want to push your project to GitHub.\n# First, create repository on GitHub website # Then add it as remote git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/MyApp.git # Verify remote git remote -v # Output: # origin https://github.com/yourusername/MyApp.git (fetch) # origin https://github.com/yourusername/MyApp.git (push) # Push main branch to GitHub git push -u origin main # Push feature branch git checkout feature/login git push -u origin feature/login # Now others can see your code! 5. Collaborating with Others Scenario: Your teammate made changes to the main branch.\n# Get latest changes git checkout main git pull origin main # Output: # From https://github.com/yourusername/MyApp # * branch main -\u0026gt; FETCH_HEAD # Updating a1b2c3d..e5f6g7h # Fast-forward # app.js | 10 +++++++--- # 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-) # Update your feature branch with latest main git checkout feature/login git merge main # If conflicts occur, resolve them: nano conflicted-file.js # (fix conflicts between \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; ==== \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; markers) git add conflicted-file.js git commit -m \u0026#34;Merge main into feature/login\u0026#34; 6. Merging Feature Branch Scenario: Your login feature is complete and tested.\n# Switch to main branch git checkout main # Make sure main is up to date git pull origin main # Merge feature branch git merge feature/login # Output: # Updating e5f6g7h..j8k9l0m # Fast-forward # login.js | 145 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ # 1 file changed, 145 insertions(+) # Push to GitHub git push origin main # Delete feature branch locally git branch -d feature/login # Delete from GitHub git push origin --delete feature/login 7. Fixing Mistakes Mistake 1: Wrong commit message # Last commit had typo in message git commit --amend -m \u0026#34;Add login feature with validation (fixed typo)\u0026#34; Mistake 2: Forgot to add file # Made commit but forgot to add a file git add forgotten-file.js git commit --amend --no-edit Mistake 3: Want to undo last commit # Keep changes but undo commit git reset --soft HEAD~1 # Now you can modify and recommit git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Better commit message\u0026#34; Mistake 4: Committed to wrong branch # Oh no! Committed to main instead of feature branch # 1. Create new branch (keeps the commit) git branch feature/new-feature # 2. Reset main to previous state git reset --hard HEAD~1 # 3. Switch to new branch git checkout feature/new-feature # Now the commit is on the correct branch! 8. Using Stash Scenario: You\u0026rsquo;re working on a feature but need to quickly fix a bug on main.\n# Currently on feature/dashboard with uncommitted changes git status # Output: Modified: dashboard.js # Stash your work git stash save \u0026#34;Dashboard work in progress\u0026#34; # Switch to main git checkout main # Fix bug nano bugfix.js git add bugfix.js git commit -m \u0026#34;Fix critical bug in authentication\u0026#34; # Push fix git push origin main # Go back to feature git checkout feature/dashboard # Restore your work git stash pop # Continue working... 9. Viewing History Scenario: You need to find when a bug was introduced.\n# View recent commits git log --oneline -10 # Search commits git log --grep=\u0026#34;authentication\u0026#34; # See what changed in a commit git show a1b2c3d # Find who changed a line git blame login.js # See file history git log --follow -- login.js # Compare two commits git diff a1b2c3d..e5f6g7h # Beautiful graph of branches git log --graph --oneline --all --decorate 10. Advanced: Interactive Rebase Scenario: You made 5 small commits but want to combine them into 1 before merging.\n# View last 5 commits git log --oneline -5 # Output: # e5e5e5e Fix typo # d4d4d4d Add comments # c3c3c3c Update logic # b2b2b2b Add feature # a1a1a1a Initial implementation # Start interactive rebase git rebase -i HEAD~5 # Editor opens with: # pick a1a1a1a Initial implementation # pick b2b2b2b Add feature # pick c3c3c3c Update logic # pick d4d4d4d Add comments # pick e5e5e5e Fix typo # Change to: # pick a1a1a1a Initial implementation # squash b2b2b2b Add feature # squash c3c3c3c Update logic # squash d4d4d4d Add comments # squash e5e5e5e Fix typo # Save and close editor # New editor opens for combined commit message # Write: \u0026#34;Implement complete login feature\u0026#34; # Now you have 1 clean commit instead of 5! Termux-Specific Tips Storage Access: If working with files in phone storage: termux-setup-storage cd ~/storage/shared SSH Keys for GitHub (avoid password every time): # Generate SSH key ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \u0026#34;your_email@example.com\u0026#34; # Copy public key cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub # Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key # Then use SSH URLs: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git Credential Helper (cache HTTPS passwords): git config --global credential.helper cache git config --global credential.helper \u0026#39;cache --timeout=7200\u0026#39; Best Practices Commit Often: Small, focused commits are better than large ones Write Good Messages: Explain why, not just what Pull Before Push: Always get latest changes first Branch for Features: Keep main branch stable Review Before Commit: Use git diff and git status Don\u0026rsquo;t Commit Secrets: Use .gitignore for API keys, passwords Tag Releases: Use semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.) Quick Troubleshooting \u0026ldquo;fatal: not a git repository\u0026rdquo;\n# You\u0026#39;re not in a Git repository # Either initialize: git init # Or navigate to your project: cd ~/myproject \u0026ldquo;fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories\u0026rdquo;\n# When pulling from a remote for first time: git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories \u0026ldquo;Your branch is ahead of \u0026lsquo;origin/main\u0026rsquo; by X commits\u0026rdquo;\n# You have unpushed commits: git push origin main \u0026ldquo;Your branch is behind \u0026lsquo;origin/main\u0026rsquo; by X commits\u0026rdquo;\n# Remote has newer commits: git pull origin main This comprehensive guide covers everything you need for daily Git usage in Termux.

--comment \u0026#34;Closing as won\u0026#39;t fix\u0026#34; done Best Practices Always authenticate first: gh auth login Use --help liberally: Every command has detailed help Start with interactive mode: Many commands have interactive modes (e.g., gh pr create) Use aliases: Create shortcuts for frequent operations Combine with git: Use gh alongside regular git commands Enable auto-completion: Improves productivity significantly Use JSON output for scripting: --json flag for automation Watch instead of polling: Use gh run watch instead of repeatedly checking Integration Examples With CI/CD: # In your CI script gh release create $VERSION --generate-notes gh release upload $VERSION ./artifacts/* With Issue Tracking: # Create issue from test failures if ! npm test; then gh issue create --title \u0026#34;Tests failing on $(date)\u0026#34; --body \u0026#34;$(npm test 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1)\u0026#34; --label bug fi With Git Hooks: # In .git/hooks/pre-push #!/bin/bash if gh pr view \u0026amp;\u0026gt;/dev/null; then echo \u0026#34;PR exists, running checks...\u0026#34; gh pr checks --watch fi Sources This guide was compiled from:\nOfficial GitHub CLI Documentation:

Active development with regular updates Source: Official HTTPie documentation at httpie.io/docs/cli\n--- # Explanation \u0026amp; Examples ## How HTTPie Works HTTPie uses an intuitive syntax that\u0026#39;s more human-friendly than curl: ### 1. **Request Items Syntax** The magic of HTTPie is in how it interprets different operators: **Query Parameters (`==`):** ```bash http GET example.com/search q==python lang==en # Becomes: example.com/search?q=python\u0026amp;lang=en JSON Fields (= and :=):\nhttp POST example.com name=John age:=30 active:=true # Sends: {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 30, \u0026#34;active\u0026#34;: true} The difference:\n= treats the value as a string := treats the value as raw JSON (numbers, booleans, objects) 2. Headers (:): http example.com User-Agent:MyApp X-API-Key:secret123 # Adds these as HTTP headers 3. Automatic JSON HTTPie automatically assumes JSON for POST/PUT/PATCH:\nhttp POST api.example.com name=John # Content-Type: application/json is automatic # Body: {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;} For forms, use --form:\nhttp --form POST api.example.com name=John # Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded # Body: name=John Real-World Examples Example 1: Building a TODO App API Test # 1.

It\u0026rsquo;s like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice, filter, map, and transform structured data.\nWhy Use jq? Parse and pretty-print JSON Extract specific fields from API responses Transform JSON structures Filter data based on conditions Combine multiple JSON files Process JSON in shell scripts Basic Syntax jq [options] \u0026#39;\u0026lt;filter\u0026gt;\u0026#39; [file...] Common Options . - Identity filter (outputs input unchanged) -r - Raw output (without quotes) -c - Compact output (single line) -n - No input (useful with --arg) -s - Slurp (read entire input into array) -e - Exit with status code based on output -M - Monochrome (no colors) -C - Colorize output (default for terminals) Essential Daily Commands 1.

Extract field jq '.field' Raw output jq -r '.field' Array element jq '.[0]' Array slice jq '.[2:5]' All elements jq '.[]' Filter jq '.[] | select(.age \u0026gt; 25)' Map jq 'map(.field)' Sort jq 'sort_by(.field)' Group jq 'group_by(.field)' Unique jq 'unique' Keys jq 'keys' Length jq 'length' Add field jq '. + {new: \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;}' Delete field jq 'del(.field)' Merge jq -s 'add' First jq 'first' Last jq 'last' Min/Max jq 'min' / jq 'max' Sum jq 'add' Contains jq 'contains(\u0026quot;text\u0026quot;)' Resources Official Manual: https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/ GitHub Repository: https://github.com/jqlang/jq jq Play (Online): https://jqplay.org/ Tutorial: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/ Version Information This guide is based on jq 1.7+ (latest stable as of 2025).\nCheck your version in Termux:\njq --version Update jq in Termux:\npkg update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; pkg upgrade jq Last Updated: October 2025\nCreated for: Termux environment on Android\n--- ## Detailed Explanation and Usage Guide ### How to Use This Guide in Termux **jq** is already installed in your Termux, so you can start using it immediately. Here\u0026#39;s how to effectively work with this guide: #### 1. **Basic Usage Pattern** Every jq command follows this structure: ```bash echo \u0026#39;JSON_DATA\u0026#39; | jq \u0026#39;FILTER\u0026#39; or\njq \u0026#39;FILTER\u0026#39; filename.json 2. Understanding Filters Filters are the core of jq. Think of them as instructions telling jq what to do with your JSON:\n. = \u0026ldquo;show me everything\u0026rdquo; .name = \u0026ldquo;show me the name field\u0026rdquo; .[] = \u0026ldquo;show me each element\u0026rdquo; select() = \u0026ldquo;filter based on condition\u0026rdquo; 3. Practical Learning Path Week 1 - Basics:\nStart with pretty printing: jq '.' Extract single fields: jq '.fieldname' Work with arrays: jq '.[0]', jq '.[]' Week 2 - Filtering:\nUse select() to filter data Learn map() for transformations Practice with real API responses Week 3 - Advanced:\nCombine filters with pipes | Create new JSON structures Use variables and functions 4. Real-World Practice Examples for Termux Example A: Monitor Your Phone Battery\n# Get battery percentage (Termux API required) termux-battery-status | jq \u0026#39;.percentage\u0026#39; # Create alert if battery low BATTERY=$(termux-battery-status | jq \u0026#39;.percentage\u0026#39;) if [ $BATTERY -lt 20 ]; then termux-notification --title \u0026#34;Low Battery\u0026#34; --content \u0026#34;Battery at ${BATTERY}%\u0026#34; fi Example B: Process Downloaded Data\n# Download JSON data curl -s \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/users/torvalds\u0026#34; -o user.json # Extract interesting information jq \u0026#39;{ name: .name, followers: .followers, repos: .public_repos, joined: .created_at }\u0026#39; user.json Example C: Configuration Management\n# Create a config file cat \u0026gt; myconfig.json \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF { \u0026#34;api\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;abc123\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;endpoint\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.example.com\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;settings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;theme\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dark\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;notifications\u0026#34;: true } } EOF # Read config in script API_KEY=$(jq -r \u0026#39;.api.key\u0026#39; myconfig.json) THEME=$(jq -r \u0026#39;.settings.theme\u0026#39; myconfig.json) echo \u0026#34;Using API key: $API_KEY\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Theme: $THEME\u0026#34; Example D: Log Analysis\n# Create sample log file (NDJSON - newline delimited JSON) cat \u0026gt; app.log \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF {\u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2025-10-28T10:00:00\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;level\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;info\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;App started\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2025-10-28T10:15:00\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;level\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Connection failed\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2025-10-28T10:30:00\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;level\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;info\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;App recovered\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2025-10-28T11:00:00\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;level\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Timeout occurred\u0026#34;} EOF # Count errors cat app.log | jq -s \u0026#39;[.[] | select(.level == \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;)] | length\u0026#39; # Get all error messages cat app.log | jq -r \u0026#39;select(.level == \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;) | .message\u0026#39; # Create error report cat app.log | jq -s \u0026#39;[.[] | select(.level == \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;)] | { total_errors: length, messages: [.[] | .message] }\u0026#39; Example E: Working with APIs in Scripts\n#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash # weather.sh - Simple weather script CITY=\u0026#34;London\u0026#34; API_KEY=\u0026#34;your_api_key\u0026#34; URL=\u0026#34;https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${CITY}\u0026amp;appid=${API_KEY}\u0026#34; # Fetch and parse weather data curl -s \u0026#34;$URL\u0026#34; | jq \u0026#39;{ city: .name, temperature: (.main.temp - 273.15 | round), condition: .weather[0].main, humidity: .main.humidity }\u0026#39; | jq -r \u0026#39;\u0026#34;Weather in \\(.city): \\(.temperature)°C, \\(.condition), Humidity: \\(.humidity)%\u0026#34;\u0026#39; 5.

Rclone is licensed under MIT License.\nLast Updated: October 2025\nRclone Version: v1.68+\nCompatible with: Termux on Android 7.0+\nRemember: Always test with --dry-run before performing destructive operations like sync or purge!\n--- ## Detailed Explanation and Usage ### How to Use This Guide #### 1. **First Time Setup** Start by configuring your first remote (e.g., Google Drive): ```bash rclone config Follow the interactive prompts:\nChoose n for \u0026ldquo;New remote\u0026rdquo; Enter a name (e.g., \u0026ldquo;mydrive\u0026rdquo;) Choose storage type (e.g., \u0026ldquo;drive\u0026rdquo; for Google Drive) Follow authentication steps Save and exit 2. Basic Operations Once configured, you can immediately start using these commands:\nList your files:\nrclone ls mydrive: Copy photos to cloud:\nrclone copy /sdcard/DCIM mydrive:Photos --progress Download from cloud:\nrclone copy mydrive:Documents /sdcard/Documents --progress 3. Understanding Sync vs Copy COPY - Only adds/updates files, never deletes:\nrclone copy /sdcard/Documents mydrive:Backup # Safe: Original files remain even if removed from source later SYNC - Makes destination identical to source (DANGEROUS):\nrclone sync /sdcard/Documents mydrive:Backup # DANGER: Deletes files in mydrive:Backup not in /sdcard/Documents BISYNC - Two-way synchronization (NEW):\nrclone bisync /sdcard/Documents mydrive:Backup --resync # First time rclone bisync /sdcard/Documents mydrive:Backup # Subsequent runs # Safe: Syncs changes both directions with conflict handling 4. Daily Workflow Examples Morning: Backup photos taken yesterday\nrclone copy /sdcard/DCIM mydrive:Photos \\ --max-age 24h \\ --progress Evening: Sync documents both ways\nrclone bisync /sdcard/Documents mydrive:Documents \\ --conflict-resolve newer \\ --verbose Weekly: Archive old downloads\nrclone move /sdcard/Download mydrive:Archive/Downloads \\ --min-age 7d \\ --delete-empty-src-dirs \\ -P 5. Safety Tips Always test first with --dry-run:\nrclone sync /sdcard/Important mydrive:Backup --dry-run -v Use --backup-dir for safety:\nrclone sync /sdcard/Documents mydrive:Documents \\ --backup-dir mydrive:Trash \\ --suffix -backup-$(date +%Y%m%d) Enable logging:\nrclone copy /sdcard/files mydrive:Backup \\ --log-file=/sdcard/rclone.log \\ --log-level INFO 6. Performance Optimization For fast WiFi:\nrclone copy /sdcard/Videos mydrive:Videos \\ --transfers=16 \\ --checkers=16 \\ --buffer-size=64M \\ -P For slow/metered connection:\nrclone copy /sdcard/Videos mydrive:Videos \\ --transfers=2 \\ --bwlimit=500K \\ -P 7. Automation in Termux Create a backup script (~/backup.sh):\n#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash # Acquire wake lock termux-wake-lock # Run backup rclone copy /sdcard/DCIM mydrive:Photos \\ --include \u0026#34;*.{jpg,png,mp4}\u0026#34; \\ --log-file=/sdcard/backup.log \\ -P # Send notification termux-notification -t \u0026#34;Backup Complete\u0026#34; -c \u0026#34;Photos backed up successfully\u0026#34; # Release wake lock termux-wake-unlock Make it executable:\nchmod +x ~/backup.sh Run manually or schedule it.\nKey Concepts Explained 1. Remote Syntax remote: = root of remote storage remote:path/to/folder = specific folder /sdcard/ = local Android storage 2. Transfer Modes copy = Add/update only sync = Make identical (deletes extras) move = Copy then delete source bisync = Two-way sync 3. Filtering --include = Only these files --exclude = Skip these files --min-age = Older than X --max-age = Newer than X --min-size / --max-size = Size filters 4. VFS Cache Modes (for mounting) off = No caching (slow but safe) minimal = Cache file structure only writes = Cache writes locally first full = Cache everything (fastest) Common Use Cases Use Case 1: Student - Document Backup # Daily sync of study materials rclone bisync ~/storage/documents mydrive:University \\ --conflict-resolve newer \\ --create-empty-src-dirs Use Case 2: Photographer - Photo Management # Upload today\u0026#39;s photos rclone copy /sdcard/DCIM mydrive:Photography/2025 \\ --include \u0026#34;*.{jpg,JPG,raw,RAW}\u0026#34; \\ --max-age 24h \\ -P # Archive photos older than 30 days rclone move /sdcard/DCIM mydrive:Photography/Archive \\ --min-age 30d \\ --create-empty-src-dirs Use Case 3: Developer - Code Sync # Sync git repositories rclone sync ~/projects mydrive:Backup/Projects \\ --exclude \u0026#34;.git/**\u0026#34; \\ --exclude \u0026#34;node_modules/**\u0026#34; \\ --exclude \u0026#34;*.log\u0026#34; \\ --delete-excluded Use Case 4: Content Creator - Video Backup # Upload rendered videos rclone copy ~/Videos/Rendered mydrive:YouTube/Uploads \\ --include \u0026#34;*.mp4\u0026#34; \\ --min-size 10M \\ --transfers=4 \\ -P This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to use rclone effectively in Termux as of 2025.

Always keep multiple secure copies of your repository password!\n--- ## Detailed Explanation and How to Use ### Understanding Restic Concepts #### 1. **Repository** - A repository is like a safe where all your backups are stored - It\u0026#39;s encrypted with your password - Can be local (SD card) or remote (cloud) - You initialize it once with `restic init` #### 2. **Snapshots** - Each backup creates a \u0026#34;snapshot\u0026#34; - a point-in-time copy - Snapshots are incremental (only changed data is stored) - You can restore from any snapshot - Old snapshots can be deleted to save space #### 3. **Deduplication** - Restic breaks files into blocks - Identical blocks are stored only once - Saves massive amounts of space - Works across all files and all snapshots #### 4. **Encryption** - ALL data is encrypted before leaving your device - Uses AES-256 encryption - Even file names are encrypted - Cloud provider can\u0026#39;t read your data --- ### Getting Started (Step by Step) #### Step 1: Create Password File ```bash # Create secure password echo \u0026#34;MyVerySecurePassword123!\u0026#34; \u0026gt; ~/.restic-password chmod 600 ~/.restic-password # IMPORTANT: Back this up somewhere safe! # Without it, your backups are unrecoverable Step 2: Initialize Repository # For local backups export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=\u0026#34;/sdcard/backup-repo\u0026#34; export RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE=\u0026#34;~/.restic-password\u0026#34; restic init # For cloud (example with rclone) export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=\u0026#34;rclone:mydrive:restic-backup\u0026#34; restic init Step 3: Create Your First Backup # Simple backup restic backup /sdcard/Documents # Check what was backed up restic snapshots Step 4: Restore Data # List available snapshots restic snapshots # Restore latest restic restore latest --target /sdcard/restored Daily Usage Patterns Pattern 1: Quick Photo Backup # Morning - backup new photos restic backup /sdcard/DCIM --tag morning-photos # Check backup restic snapshots --tag morning-photos Pattern 2: Document Version Control # Before editing important document restic backup /sdcard/Documents/thesis.pdf --tag before-edit # After editing restic backup /sdcard/Documents/thesis.pdf --tag after-edit # If you need old version restic find thesis.pdf restic restore \u0026lt;snapshot-id\u0026gt; --target /tmp --include thesis.pdf Pattern 3: Full System Backup # Weekly full backup restic backup \\ /sdcard/Documents \\ /sdcard/DCIM \\ /sdcard/Music \\ /data/data/com.termux/files/home \\ --tag weekly-full Understanding Retention Policies # Keep structure: --keep-last 3 # 3 most recent snapshots --keep-hourly 24 # One per hour for 24 hours --keep-daily 7 # One per day for 7 days --keep-weekly 4 # One per week for 4 weeks --keep-monthly 12 # One per month for 12 months --keep-yearly 2 # One per year for 2 years # Example timeline: # Today: 3 backups (keep-last 3) # Yesterday: 1 backup (keep-daily) # Last week: 1 backup (keep-weekly) # Last month: 1 backup (keep-monthly) # Last year: 1 backup (keep-yearly) Practical Scenarios Scenario 1: Accidental File Deletion # Oh no!

Use Background Mode for Long Downloads wget -bc -o download.log LARGE_FILE_URL 4. Save Bandwidth with Timestamping # Only download if newer wget -N URL 5. Use Config File for Consistent Settings # Edit ~/.wgetrc once, benefit always nano ~/.wgetrc 6. Verify Downloads # Download checksum file wget https://example.com/file.zip wget https://example.com/file.zip.sha256 # Verify sha256sum -c file.zip.sha256 7. Log Everything for Debugging wget -o download.log -d URL # -d for debug mode 8.

Here\u0026#39;s how our trinity embodies this: ```bash # The Flow: fd (finds files) → fzf (lets you choose) → bat (shows content) # In practice: fd --type f | fzf --preview \u0026#39;bat --color=always {}\u0026#39; Real Example Breakdown Let\u0026rsquo;s break down this powerful command:\nrg --line-number --color=always . | \\ fzf --ansi \\ --delimiter : \\ --preview \u0026#39;bat --color=always {1} --highlight-line {2}\u0026#39; \\ --preview-window \u0026#39;+{2}+3/3\u0026#39; What\u0026rsquo;s happening:\nrg --line-number --color=always .\nSearch all files in current directory Show line numbers Keep colors in output fzf --ansi\nAccept colored input from rg Make it interactive --delimiter :\nSplit results at : character Results look like: file.js:42:function hello() --preview 'bat --color=always {1} --highlight-line {2}'\nShow the file ({1} = filename) Highlight the line ({2} = line number) --preview-window '+{2}+3/3'\nJump to the line in preview Show 3 lines of context Why It\u0026rsquo;s Fast # Traditional approach (slow): find . -name \u0026#34;*.js\u0026#34; -exec grep -l \u0026#34;function\u0026#34; {} \\; # Problems: Spawns new process for each file, no parallelism # Modern approach (fast): rg -t js \u0026#34;function\u0026#34; # Advantages: Single process, parallel search, skips binaries Daily Workflow Examples Morning Developer Routine # 1.

in Rust (compiled, not interpreted) Parallel execution by default Ignores .git and respects .gitignore Doesn\u0026rsquo;t stat files unnecessarily rg is faster than grep because:\nUses finite automata for regex Memory-mapped file reading Parallel search across files Skips binary files automatically Respects .gitignore fzf is fast because:\nWritten in Go (compiled) Efficient fuzzy matching algorithm Async preview generation Minimal memory footprint Optimization Strategies # Bad: Search everything fd | rg \u0026#34;pattern\u0026#34; # Good: Limit scope fd -e js -e py --max-depth 3 | rg \u0026#34;pattern\u0026#34; # Better: Use type filters rg -t javascript -t python \u0026#34;pattern\u0026#34; # Best: Combine with exclusions rg -t js \u0026#34;pattern\u0026#34; --glob

Install them via:\npkg install ffmpeg For the latest FFmpeg version and features, always refer to the official documentation at https://ffmpeg.org\n--- ## Detailed Explanation \u0026amp; Usage Guide ### How to Use This Guide #### 1. **Understanding the Command Structure** Every FFmpeg command follows this pattern: ffmpeg [global_options] [input_options] -i input_file [output_options] output_file\n**Example Breakdown:** ```bash ffmpeg -y -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a aac output.mp4 ffmpeg - The program -y - Global option (overwrite without asking) -i input.mp4 - Input file -c:v libx264 - Video codec (H.264) -crf 23 - Quality setting -c:a aac - Audio codec output.mp4 - Output file 2. Essential Concepts Codecs vs Containers:\nContainer (MP4, MKV, AVI): The file format that holds video/audio streams Codec (H.264, H.265, AAC): The compression method for the actual data Copy vs Re-encode:\n-c copy # Fast, no quality loss, but limited editing -c:v libx264 # Re-encodes, slower, allows modifications Stream Selection:\n-c:v - Video codec -c:a - Audio codec -c:s - Subtitle codec -vn - No video -an - No audio 3. Practical Examples with Explanations Example 1: Compress a Video for Mobile\nffmpeg -i large_video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -preset medium -vf scale=1280:-1 -c:a aac -b:a 128k mobile.mp4 What this does:\nTakes large_video.mp4 as input Uses H.264 codec (libx264) Sets quality to 28 (lower file size, acceptable quality) Uses medium encoding speed Scales width to 1280px, auto-calculates height Uses AAC audio at 128kbps Outputs to mobile.mp4 When to use: Sharing videos on WhatsApp, Telegram, or reducing storage usage\nExample 2: Extract Audio from Multiple Videos\n#!/bin/bash for video in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i \u0026#34;$video\u0026#34; -vn -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 2 \u0026#34;${video%.mp4}.mp3\u0026#34; done What this does:\nLoops through all MP4 files in current directory Extracts audio without video (-vn) Converts to MP3 with high quality (-q:a 2) Names output files matching input (e.g., video.mp4 → video.mp3) When to use: Creating audio-only versions of video lectures, music videos, or podcasts\nExample 3: Create Instagram-Ready Video\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\ -vf \u0026#34;scale=1080:1350:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=1080:1350:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2:color=black\u0026#34; \\ -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 \\ -c:a aac -b:a 128k \\ -movflags +faststart \\ -t 60 \\ instagram.mp4 What this does:\nScales video to Instagram\u0026rsquo;s 4:5 ratio (1080x1350) Adds black padding if needed to maintain aspect ratio Centers the video Limits duration to 60 seconds (-t 60) Enables fast start for quick loading Uses good quality settings When to use: Preparing videos for Instagram feed posts\nExample 4: Batch Convert All Videos to HEVC\nmkdir -p converted for file in *.mp4; do echo \u0026#34;Converting: $file\u0026#34; ffmpeg -i \u0026#34;$file\u0026#34; \\ -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -preset medium \\ -c:a copy \\ \u0026#34;converted/${file%.mp4}_hevc.mp4\u0026#34; done echo \u0026#34;All conversions complete!\u0026#34; What this does:\nCreates a \u0026ldquo;converted\u0026rdquo; directory Converts each MP4 to H.265/HEVC (better compression) Copies audio without re-encoding (faster, no quality loss) Saves to new directory with \u0026ldquo;_hevc\u0026rdquo; suffix When to use: Saving storage space with better compression\n4.

Simple Search** ```bash fd download What it does: Searches for any file or directory containing \u0026ldquo;download\u0026rdquo; in its name, starting from current directory.\nOutput example:\nDownloads/ download_manager.py my_download.txt 2. Search by Extension fd -e pdf What it does: Finds all PDF files in current directory and subdirectories.\nReal-world use: Finding all your PDFs in Termux storage\nfd -e pdf ~/storage 3. Type-Specific Search Find only directories:\nfd -t d backup This shows only directories with \u0026ldquo;backup\u0026rdquo; in the name, ignoring files.\nFind only files:\nfd -t f -e sh Shows only shell script files (not directories named *.sh).\n4. Including Hidden Files By default, fd ignores:\nHidden files/directories (starting with .) Patterns in .gitignore To show hidden files:\nfd -H .bashrc To show EVERYTHING (hidden + ignored):\nfd -H -I node_modules Practical Real-World Examples for Termux Example 1: Finding Your Downloaded Videos cd ~/storage/downloads fd -e mp4 -e mkv -e avi Explanation: Searches for video files with these extensions. Great for organizing your downloads.\nExample 2: Cleaning Up Old Log Files fd -e log -x rm {} Explanation:\n-e log finds all .log files -x rm {} executes rm on each file {} is placeholder for found filename Safer version (confirm before delete):\nfd -e log -x rm -i {} Example 3: Finding Large Files Eating Your Storage fd -t f -S +100m ~/storage Explanation:\n-t f = only files (not directories) -S +100m = size greater than 100 megabytes Shows you the storage hogs! Example 4: Backup All Your Python Scripts # Create backup directory mkdir -p ~/backup # Copy all Python files to backup fd -e py -x cp {} ~/backup/ Example 5: Find Recently Modified Files fd -t f -c +1d Explanation: Shows files modified in the last 1 day. Useful for finding what you recently worked on.\nTime options:\n+1h = last hour +1d = last day +1w = last week -1w = older than 1 week Example 6: Search Multiple Locations fd screenshot ~/storage/DCIM ~/storage/Pictures ~/storage/Downloads Searches for screenshots in multiple directories at once.\nExample 7: Case-Insensitive Search fd -i readme Finds: README, readme, ReadMe, README.md, etc.\nExample 8: Execute Complex Commands # Find all images and resize them fd -e jpg -e png -x convert {} -resize 50% resized_{} # Find all text files and count words fd -e txt -x wc -w {} # Find and compress all logs fd -e log -x gzip {} Advanced Patterns Using Regular Expressions # Files starting with \u0026#39;test\u0026#39; followed by numbers fd \u0026#39;^test[0-9]+\u0026#39; # Files ending with _backup fd \u0026#39;_backup$\u0026#39; # Python files with \u0026#39;util\u0026#39; or \u0026#39;helper\u0026#39; fd \u0026#39;(util|helper).*\\.py$\u0026#39; Combining Multiple Filters # Large video files modified recently fd -e mp4 -S +50m -c +7d # Hidden config files in home directory fd -H -g \u0026#39;.*.conf\u0026#39; ~ # Executable scripts larger than 1MB fd -t x -S +1m -e sh Parallel Processing # Convert all images using 4 parallel processes fd -e jpg -j 4 -x convert {} {.}.png Explanation:\n-j 4 = use 4 threads {.} = filename without extension Faster on devices with multiple cores Integration with Other Tools With fzf (fuzzy finder) # Interactive file selection fd | fzf | xargs -I {} nano {} With grep # Find Python files containing \u0026#34;import requests\u0026#34; fd -e py -x grep -l \u0026#34;import requests\u0026#34; {} With tree # Show directory structure of found items fd -t d | xargs tree Termux-Specific Use Cases 1.

Set Reasonable Timeouts curl --connect-timeout 30 --max-time 300 URL 5. Use Config File for Common Settings # Edit ~/.curlrc once echo \u0026#34;retry = 3\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.curlrc echo \u0026#34;retry-delay = 5\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.curlrc 6.
