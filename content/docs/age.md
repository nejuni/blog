```

---

## Quick Start

### Generate a Key Pair

```bash
age-keygen -o -f ~/.ssh/age_key.txt
```

### Encrypt a File

```bash
age -r <PUBLIC_KEY> -o encrypted.txt.age plaintext.txt
```

### Decrypt a File

```bash
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt encrypted.txt.age
```

---

## Basic Concepts

### Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Public Key** | Recipient key (x25519 format) - used to encrypt |
| **Private Key** | Sender key - kept secret, used to decrypt |
| **age file** | Encrypted file with .age extension (convention) |
| **Passphrase** | Alternative to key-based encryption |

### Key Formats

- **Public Keys**: Start with `age1` (example: `age1aaa2xmjspxn73gv4py3n...`)
- **Private Keys**: Start with `AGE-SECRET-KEY-1` (stored in key files)

---

## Daily Commands

### 1. Generate Keys

#### Generate a new private key and save to file

```bash
age-keygen -o -f ~/my_age_key.txt
```

**Flags:**
- `-o`: Output private key only (recommended)
- `-f`: Specify file path for the key

#### Generate multiple keys for different purposes

```bash
age-keygen -o -f ~/age_key_work.txt
age-keygen -o -f ~/age_key_personal.txt
```

#### Extract public key from private key file

```bash
age-keygen -y ~/my_age_key.txt
```

---

### 2. Encrypt Files

#### Encrypt with public key

```bash
age -r age1aaa2xmjspxn73gv4py3n... -o data.txt.age data.txt
```

#### Encrypt with your own public key (for personal use)

```bash
age -r $(age-keygen -y ~/.ssh/age_key.txt) -o myfile.txt.age myfile.txt
```

#### Encrypt with passphrase (interactive)

```bash
age -p -o encrypted.txt.age plaintext.txt
```

#### Encrypt multiple files

```bash
age -r age1... -o file1.age file1.txt
age -r age1... -o file2.age file2.txt
```

#### Encrypt and remove original

```bash
age -r age1... -o document.age document.pdf && rm document.pdf
```

#### Encrypt to multiple recipients

```bash
age -r age1_recipient1... -r age1_recipient2... -o shared.txt.age data.txt
```

---

### 3. Decrypt Files

#### Decrypt file with private key

```bash
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt encrypted.txt.age
```

#### Decrypt and save output

```bash
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt encrypted.txt.age > decrypted.txt
```

#### Decrypt with passphrase (interactive)

```bash
age -d encrypted.txt.age
```

#### Decrypt multiple files

```bash
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt file1.age > file1.txt
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt file2.age > file2.txt
```

#### Decrypt without saving to disk (piping)

```bash
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt secret.age | cat
```

---

### 4. Working with Pipes & Streams

#### Encrypt from stdin

```bash
echo "Secret message" | age -r age1... > message.age
```

#### Decrypt to stdout

```bash
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt message.age
```

#### Create encrypted archive of directory

```bash
tar czf - /path/to/directory | age -r age1... > archive.tar.gz.age
```

#### Extract encrypted archive

```bash
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt archive.tar.gz.age | tar xzf -
```

#### Encrypt database dump

```bash
mysqldump -u user -p database | age -r age1... > db_backup.sql.age
```

---

### 5. Configuration & Key Management

#### Create recipients file (for multiple recipients)

```bash
cat > recipients.txt << EOF
# My recipients
age1recipient1...
age1recipient2...
age1recipient3...
EOF
```

#### Encrypt using recipients file

```bash
age -R recipients.txt -o data.age data.txt
```

#### List public key from private key file

```bash
grep "^age1" ~/.ssh/age_key.txt
```

#### Backup private key securely

```bash
age -r age1_backup_key... -o age_key.txt.age ~/.ssh/age_key.txt
```

---

### 6. Batch Operations

#### Encrypt all files in directory

```bash
for file in *.txt; do
  age -r age1... -o "$file.age" "$file"
done
```

#### Decrypt all .age files in directory

```bash
for file in *.age; do
  age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt "$file" > "${file%.age}"
done
```

#### Find and encrypt specific files

```bash
find . -name "*.json" -exec age -r age1... -o {}.age {} \;
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Personal File Encryption

**Scenario:** Encrypt your personal documents

```bash
# Generate key
age-keygen -o -f ~/.ssh/personal_key.txt

# Get your public key
PUBLIC_KEY=$(age-keygen -y ~/.ssh/personal_key.txt)

# Encrypt sensitive document
age -r $PUBLIC_KEY -o passport_scan.jpg.age passport_scan.jpg

# Decrypt when needed
age -d -i ~/.ssh/personal_key.txt passport_scan.jpg.age > passport_scan.jpg

# Verify
file passport_scan.jpg
```

### Example 2: Secure File Sharing

**Scenario:** Share encrypted file with colleague

```bash
# Get colleague's public key: age1colleague...

# Encrypt file
age -r age1colleague... -o confidential_report.docx.age confidential_report.docx

# Send the .age file via any channel
# Colleague decrypts with their private key
age -d -i ~/colleague_key.txt confidential_report.docx.age
```

### Example 3: Backup Encryption

**Scenario:** Encrypt important backup

```bash
# Create backup
tar czf backup_2025.tar.gz ~/important_data/

# Encrypt backup
age -r $(age-keygen -y ~/.ssh/age_key.txt) \
    -o backup_2025.tar.gz.age backup_2025.tar.gz

# Remove original
rm backup_2025.tar.gz

# Later, restore from encrypted backup
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt backup_2025.tar.gz.age | tar xzf -
```

### Example 4: Passphrase Encryption (No Keys)

**Scenario:** Quick encryption with password

```bash
# Encrypt with passphrase
age -p -o secrets.txt.age secrets.txt

# Decrypt (prompts for passphrase)
age -d secrets.txt.age

# Remove original
rm secrets.txt
```

### Example 5: Multiple Recipients

**Scenario:** File encrypted for multiple team members

```bash
# Create recipients file
cat > team_recipients.txt << EOF
# Dev Team
age1dev1recipient_key_here
age1dev2recipient_key_here
age1dev3recipient_key_here
EOF

# Encrypt for all
age -R team_recipients.txt -o source_code.zip.age source_code.zip

# Each team member can decrypt with their own key
age -d -i ~/my_private_key.txt source_code.zip.age > source_code.zip
```

### Example 6: Real-time Log Encryption

**Scenario:** Encrypt system logs as they're generated

```bash
# Monitor and encrypt logs
tail -f /var/log/auth.log | age -r age1... > auth.log.age &

# Later, decrypt and analyze
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt auth.log.age | grep "Failed password"
```

### Example 7: Environment Variable Encryption

**Scenario:** Encrypt .env file with secrets

```bash
# Create environment file
cat > .env << EOF
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost/db
API_KEY=super_secret_key_12345
JWT_SECRET=another_secret
EOF

# Encrypt it
age -p -o .env.age .env && rm .env

# In your script, decrypt before use
source <(age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt .env.age)
```

### Example 8: Docker Secrets Encryption

**Scenario:** Encrypt Docker secrets

```bash
# Encrypt secret
echo "my_registry_password" | age -r age1... > docker_secret.age

# Decrypt when needed
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt docker_secret.age | docker secret create my_secret -
```

## Advanced Usage

### Using age-keygen with SSH Keys

```bash
# Generate SSH-compatible key
age-keygen -o > ~/.ssh/id_age_rsa
```

### Creating Wrapper Functions

Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Encrypt function
aenc() {
  local keyfile="${1:-$HOME/.ssh/age_key.txt}"
  shift
  public_key=$(age-keygen -y "$keyfile")
  for file in "$@"; do
    age -r "$public_key" -o "${file}.age" "$file"
  done
}

# Decrypt function
adec() {
  local keyfile="${1:-$HOME/.ssh/age_key.txt}"
  shift
  for file in "$@"; do
    age -d -i "$keyfile" "$file"
  done
}

# Usage
aenc ~/.ssh/age_key.txt myfile.txt  # Creates myfile.txt.age
adec ~/.ssh/age_key.txt myfile.txt.age  # Extracts to stdout
```

### Using with Git

Encrypt sensitive files before committing:

```bash
# Create .gitignore entry
echo "*.age" >> .gitignore

# Encrypt credentials
age -p -o credentials.json.age credentials.json
rm credentials.json

# Decrypt locally when needed
age -d credentials.json.age > credentials.json
```

### Working with SSH Agent (if supported by your age build)

```bash
# Some age builds support SSH keys
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/run/user/$(id -u)/ssh ssh-add ~/.ssh/age_key.txt

# Then use SSH identity
age -r age1... -o file.age file.txt
```

---

## Best Practices

### üîê Security

1. **Backup private keys securely**
   ```bash
   # Encrypt your private key with another key
   age -p -o age_key.txt.age ~/.ssh/age_key.txt
   ```

2. **Use strong passphrases** (20+ characters recommended)

3. **Keep private keys on secure storage** (encrypted partition, secure enclave)

4. **Rotate keys periodically** for long-term secrets

5. **Don't share private keys** - only public keys

### üìã Organization

1. **Use consistent naming conventions**
   ```bash
   # Format: project_purpose_date.age
   project_config_2025-01.age
   backup_full_2025-01-28.tar.gz.age
   ```

2. **Maintain recipients file in version control**
   ```bash
   git add recipients.txt
   ```

3. **Document key purposes** with comments:
   ```bash
   # ~/.ssh/age_keys/README.md
   - age_key_production.txt: Production server backups
   - age_key_personal.txt: Personal files and documents
   - age_key_team.txt: Shared team resources
   ```

### üîÑ Workflow

1. **Generate separate keys for different purposes**

2. **Use passphrase encryption for temporary secrets**

3. **Use key-based encryption for files meant to be shared**

4. **Test decryption before deleting originals**
   ```bash
   age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt test.age > /dev/null && echo "OK"
   ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Losing your private key** - back it up securely
2. **Forgetting your passphrase** - it cannot be recovered
3. **Encrypting with wrong public key** - verify before encrypting
4. **Keeping plaintext after encryption** - remove original files
5. **Sharing private keys** - only share public keys

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "age: bad decrypt"

**Cause:** Using wrong private key or corrupted file

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify using correct key file
age -d -i ~/.ssh/correct_key.txt file.age
```

### Issue: "no identity found"

**Cause:** Private key file not found or inaccessible

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check file exists and is readable
ls -la ~/.ssh/age_key.txt
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/age_key.txt
```

### Issue: "identity not found in recipient stanza"

**Cause:** File encrypted with different public key

**Solution:**
```bash
# Get your public key
age-keygen -y ~/.ssh/age_key.txt

# Re-encrypt file with correct public key
```

---

## Command Reference

## Comprehensive Explanation with Examples

Now let me explain how to use this tool effectively:

### **What is `age`?**

`age` is a modern file encryption tool that:
- Uses **X25519 elliptic curve cryptography** (same as SSH)
- Is **simple to use** - minimal configuration needed
- Is **secure by default** - small attack surface
- Works with **pipes and streams** - integrates with Unix tools
- Supports **multiple recipients** - one file can be decrypted by multiple people

---

### **Key Concepts Explained:**

**1. Public Key vs Private Key**
- **Public Key** (starts with `age1`): Share freely, anyone can encrypt for you
- **Private Key** (starts with `AGE-SECRET-KEY-1`): Keep secret, only you decrypt

**2. Two Encryption Methods:**
- **Key-based:** Fast, secure, for files you want to share
- **Passphrase-based:** When you don't want to manage keys

---

### **Step-by-Step Daily Usage:**

#### **Day 1: Initial Setup**

```bash
# Generate your personal key
age-keygen -o -f ~/.ssh/age_key.txt

# View output - you'll see your public key
# Example: age1aaa2xmjspxn73gv4py3n...

# Extract just the public key
age-keygen -y ~/.ssh/age_key.txt
# Output: age1aaa2xmjspxn73gv4py3n...
```

#### **Day 2: Encrypt Your First File**

```bash
# Create a test file
echo "This is secret data" > secret.txt

# Encrypt it with your public key
age -r age1aaa2xmjspxn73gv4py3n... -o secret.txt.age secret.txt

# You now have:
# secret.txt.age (encrypted - safe to share/store)
# secret.txt (original - delete this!)

# Delete the original
rm secret.txt
```

#### **Day 3: Decrypt When Needed**

```bash
# Decrypt and view content
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt secret.txt.age

# Decrypt and save to file
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt secret.txt.age > secret.txt

# Decrypt and pipe to other command
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt secret.txt.age | cat
```

---

### **Practical Real-World Examples:**

#### **Example 1: Backup Your Phone's Photos**

```bash
# Connect phone, mount photos folder, then:

# Compress all photos
tar czf photos_backup.tar.gz ~/photos/

# Encrypt backup
age -r $(age-keygen -y ~/.ssh/age_key.txt) \
    -o photos_backup.tar.gz.age \
    photos_backup.tar.gz

# Upload to cloud (safe now!)
# Cloud services can't read it

# Delete originals
rm -rf photos_backup.tar.gz
```

#### **Example 2: Share Password with Friend**

```bash
# Friend generates their key and gives you their public key
# They tell you: age1friend...

# You have a WiFi password you want to share
echo "WiFi_Pass123!" | age -r age1friend... > wifi.age

# Send them wifi.age
# They decrypt: age -d -i ~/their_key.txt wifi.age
```

#### **Example 3: Encrypt Database Credentials**

```bash
# Create credentials file
cat > db_creds.json << EOF
{
  "host": "db.example.com",
  "user": "admin",
  "password": "super_secret_password"
}
EOF

# Encrypt it
age -p -o db_creds.json.age db_creds.json
# Prompted: Enter passphrase:

# Delete original
rm db_creds.json

# In your application, before startup:
mv <(age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt db_creds.json.age) db_creds.json
# App reads db_creds.json, then system deletes it after startup
```

#### **Example 4: Secure System Backup**

```bash
# Backup /etc directory (contains system config)
sudo tar czf etc_backup.tar.gz /etc/

# Encrypt it
age -r $(age-keygen -y ~/.ssh/age_key.txt) \
    -o etc_backup.tar.gz.age \
    etc_backup.tar.gz

# Store on external USB or cloud
# If system fails, you can restore
# Decrypt: age -d -i age_key.txt etc_backup.tar.gz.age | tar xzf -
```

#### **Example 5: Create a Personal Vault Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as: ~/bin/my_vault.sh
# chmod +x ~/bin/my_vault.sh

# Personal vault manager
MY_KEY="$HOME/.ssh/age_key.txt"
VAULT_DIR="$HOME/.vault_encrypted"

mkdir -p "$VAULT_DIR"

case "$1" in
  save)
    # Save and encrypt a file
    if [ -z "$2" ]; then
      echo "Usage: my_vault.sh save <file>"
      exit 1
    fi
    PUBLIC=$(age-keygen -y "$MY_KEY")
    age -r "$PUBLIC" -o "$VAULT_DIR/$(basename $2).age" "$2"
    echo "‚úì Encrypted: $2"
    ;;
  
  open)
    # Decrypt and open
    if [ -z "$2" ]; then
      echo "Usage: my_vault.sh open <filename>"
      exit 1
    fi
    age -d -i "$MY_KEY" "$VAULT_DIR/$2.age"
    ;;
  
  list)
    # List encrypted files
    ls -lh "$VAULT_DIR"
    ;;
esac

# Usage examples:
# my_vault.sh save mypasswords.txt
# my_vault.sh list
# my_vault.sh open mypasswords.txt
```

---

### **Security Tips for Termux:**

```bash
# 1. Secure your key file permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/age_key.txt

# 2. Create a secure backup
# Encrypt your private key with a passphrase
age -p -o ~/.ssh/age_key.txt.backup.age ~/.ssh/age_key.txt

# 3. Generate work and personal keys separately
age-keygen -o -f ~/.ssh/age_work_key.txt
age-keygen -o -f ~/.ssh/age_personal_key.txt

# 4. Don't forget your passphrases!
# There's no recovery if forgotten

# 5. Test decryption works before deleting original
age -d -i ~/.ssh/age_key.txt testfile.age > /dev/null && \
echo "SUCCESS" && \
rm testfile
```
