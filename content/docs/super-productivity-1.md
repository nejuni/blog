## 🎂 Adding Yearly Repetitive Events (Birthdays, Anniversaries, Traditional Events)

### Method 1: Using Built-in Repeat Feature

**For Standard Yearly Events (Annual):**

1. **Create the task:**
   ```
   Tap + button
   Title: "John's Birthday 🎂" or "Wedding Anniversary 💍"
   Time estimate: [30m] or [1h] (for preparation/celebration)
   ```

2. **Open task details** (tap on the task)

3. **Set repeat schedule:**
   - Tap **"Repeat"** section
   - Select **"Yearly"** or **"Custom"**
   
4. **Configure yearly repeat:**
   ```
   Repeat Type: Yearly
   Start Date: November 15, 2025 (actual birthday)
   Time: 00:00 (midnight) or 08:00 AM (reminder time)
   
   ✅ Save
   ```

5. **The task will now appear:**
   - Every year on November 15
   - Automatically created 365 days after completion
   - Continues indefinitely until you delete the repeat rule

**Example Setup:**
```
Task: "Mom's Birthday 🎂"
Repeat: Yearly
Date: March 15
Time: 9:00 AM (reminder 1 week before)
Notes: "Buy gift, send card, call in evening"
Project: Personal/Family
Tags: #birthday #family #important
```

---

### Method 2: Custom Intervals (Every 3 Years, 5 Years, etc.)

**For Multi-Year Events:**

While Super Productivity's native repeat function primarily supports standard intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly), you can handle multi-year events using these workarounds:

#### **Workaround A: Manual Future Scheduling**

1. **Create the base task:**
   ```
   Task: "Car Registration Renewal 🚗"
   Date: November 4, 2025
   ```

2. **After completing, manually schedule next occurrence:**
   - Complete the task ✓
   - Create new task: "Car Registration Renewal 🚗"
   - Schedule for: November 4, 2028 (3 years later)
   - Add note: "Renews every 3 years"

3. **Use task notes as template:**
   ```
   Notes field:
   "Renews every 3 years
   Last renewed: 2025
   Next due: 2028
   Documents needed: License, insurance, proof of address"
   ```

#### **Workaround B: Yearly Reminder with Skip Pattern**

1. **Create yearly task:**
   ```
   Task: "Professional Certification Renewal (Check if due) 🎓"
   Repeat: Yearly
   Date: January 1st
   ```

2. **Add note with tracking:**
   ```
   Notes:
   "Renews every 5 years
   Last renewed: 2025
   Next renewal: 2030
   
   Just check and mark complete if not due yet.
   When 2030 hits - take action!"
   ```

3. **Each year:**
   - Check the note
   - If not due year → Mark complete immediately
   - If due year → Take action, then mark complete

#### **Workaround C: Using Subtasks for Multi-Year Planning**

```
Main Task: "Traditional Family Reunion 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦"
Repeat: Yearly (just for checking)

Subtasks:
⬜ Check if 5-year reunion due (every Jan 1)
⬜ [2025] - Not due, skip
⬜ [2030] - DUE! Start planning 6 months ahead
⬜ [2035] - DUE! 
⬜ [2040] - DUE!

Notes:
"Held every 5 years
Last: 2020
Next: 2025, 2030, 2035..."
```

### 📅 Advanced Birthday & Anniversary Setup

**Best Practice Template:**

```
Task Name Format: "[Person] Birthday 🎂 - [Age] years"
Example: "Sarah Birthday 🎂 - Turning 30"

Settings:
├─ Repeat: Yearly
├─ Date: Actual birthday
├─ Time: 08:00 AM (1 week before for reminder)
├─ Estimate: [30m] - [2h] (depending on celebration)
├─ Project: "Family & Friends"
├─ Tags: #birthday #important #personal
└─ Priority: High

Notes Template:
"Birthday: November 15

Gift ideas: [books, gadgets, experiences]
Favorite: [chocolate cake, Italian food]

⬜ Send birthday card [3 days before] [15m]
⬜ Make restaurant reservation [1 week before] [15m]
⬜ Call/visit on the day [1h]
```

**Setting Advance Reminders:**

Since you can't set "remind 1 week before" natively, use this method:

1. **Create TWO tasks:**
   
   **Task 1 - Reminder:**
   ```
   "Reminder: Sarah's Birthday next week 📅"
   Repeat: Yearly
   Date: November 8 (1 week before)
   Time: 9:00 AM
   Notes: "Birthday is November 15 - start planning!"
   ```
   
   **Task 2 - Actual Birthday:**
   ```
   "Sarah's Birthday 🎂"
   Repeat: Yearly
   Date: November 15
   Time: 9:00 AM
   Notes: [full details as above]
   ```
